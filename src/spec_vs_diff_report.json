  "summary": "REQ-14 is largely implemented: the CalendarView h2 now renders a primary heading line with a smaller, muted one-sentence English description beneath it. However, the diff summary indicates changes beyond the selected h2 element, which conflicts with the constraint/AC that only the selected h2 be modified.",

      "requirement": "Only the selected h2 element at XPath /html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/main[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/h2[1] is modified; no other layout/elements are changed in this build.",
      "reason": "The CalendarView.tsx diff summary shows additional non-h2-related logic/commentary (e.g., expanded 'hasSavedContent' checks) implying modifications outside the selected h2 element, violating the 'ONLY to the selected element' constraint/AC.",
