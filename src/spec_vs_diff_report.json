  "summary": "The diff modifies CompareSlotHeader to render an Option banner with rounded top corners and card background, but there is no visible change in PhotoComparisonView (or the slot card/container layout) in the provided diff summary to confirm the top-gap removal and full unification of the banner with the overall slot card container.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "In the Progress Comparison modal side-by-side view, each slot’s Option banner must be part of the same underlying larger card container and start at the very top edge where the card’s rounded corners are, eliminating any gap above the banner, consistently for Options 1–3 without layout regressions.",
      "reason": "Only CompareSlotHeader.tsx is shown as modified; there is no evidence in the diff summary of changes to the parent slot/card container in PhotoComparisonView that would remove any existing outer padding/margin/band above the header or ensure the card’s rounded corners are applied to the unified banner+card container as a single continuous box.",
