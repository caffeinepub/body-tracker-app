  "summary": "REQ-2 appears implemented by updating the 2nd entry in `PREVIEW_IMAGES` on `LoginPage.tsx` to `/assets/cal.png` while keeping 4 images. REQ-1 is not implemented because no new static asset file was added under `frontend/public/assets/`. Additional unrequested modifications were made to `frontend-file-summaries.txt` and `project_state.json`.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add the uploaded image file `cal.png` as a static frontend asset under `frontend/public/assets/` so it can be referenced at runtime without any resizing/cropping/styling changes.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added files, so `frontend/public/assets/cal.png` was not created and therefore cannot be served at `/assets/cal.png`.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: Added: 0 (no added files)",
