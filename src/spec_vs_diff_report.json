  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented via local Tailwind class overrides in CalendarView (border-2 + border-border) without touching shared UI components. However, the diff also introduces additional visual changes (e.g., calendar shadow) and modifies non-requested metadata/summary files.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added a drop shadow to the main calendar component (shadow-lg), which is beyond the requested border-only prominence change.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest asks to make borders slightly more prominent and explicitly avoids broader visual redesign; shadow is an extra visual enhancement not requested.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/CalendarView.tsx (CalendarComponent className includes \"... border-2 border-border shadow-lg\")"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Updated/added detailed narrative summaries describing many unrelated UI and feature behaviors (e.g., PhotoComparisonView slots, analytics charts, DayDetailView changes).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is limited to border prominence for two specific elements in CalendarView; these summary updates describe unrelated changes and are not requested deliverables.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Modified project tracking state (project_state.json) setting up new_feature_requests entries unrelated to implementing the UI change itself.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest did not request changes to project metadata/state files; this is outside the specified frontend UI scope.",
      "evidence": [
        "project_state.json"
      ]
