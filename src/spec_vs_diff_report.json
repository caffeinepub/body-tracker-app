  "summary": "The diff does not provide clear evidence that the targeted button received a rotating subtle animated glowing border with reduced-motion handling. The visible changes include global/theme-related CSS and other unrelated UI styling additions that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Apply a subtle animated glowing border that continuously rotates around the border of the specific button at the given XPath, preserving size/layout/click behavior; support light/dark themes; keep hover/active/disabled behavior; disable animation under prefers-reduced-motion; apply only to that button.",
      "reason": "In the provided diff excerpts, there is no visible CSS for a rotating border/glow animation (e.g., keyframes, conic-gradient border, pseudo-element ring) and no evidence in the shown LoginPage button snippet of a unique class/attribute being applied to only that specific button. Also no shown prefers-reduced-motion media query handling or disabled-state glow suppression.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/index.css (truncated excerpt shows base variables and unrelated styles; no rotating glow animation visible)",
        "frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx (truncated; Button props shown only up to onClick={login}, no glow-related className/variant evidence visible)"

      "reason": "The BuildRequest is specifically about adding an animated rotating glow border to one selected button and explicitly lists non-goals including not changing other UI behavior. Forcing a global dark color scheme is unrelated to the requested button-only glow effect.",

        "frontend/src/index.css (body { ... color-scheme: dark; })"

      "description": "Adding calendar day 'saved content' dot indicator styling (.has-saved-content and related selectors).",
      "reason": "Not requested; the BuildRequest is limited to a rotating glow border on a specific button and explicitly says not to apply the same effect broadly or change other UI behavior.",
