  "summary": "The diff does not provide evidence that the specified LoginPage button received a thicker/brighter animated rainbow glow with disabled and reduced-motion behavior. Multiple unrelated styling/feature changes appear to have been made outside the requested scope.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update only the button at XPath /html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/main[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/button[1] so its border/glow is thicker and brighter, uses an animated rainbow spectrum, preserves size/layout/click behavior, is subdued and non-animated when disabled, and disables animation under prefers-reduced-motion while keeping a static rainbow glow.",
      "reason": "LoginPage.tsx is truncated right where the <Button> props/classes would show the styling hook, and index.css excerpt does not show any rainbow/animated glow styles, prefers-reduced-motion handling, or disabled-state glow handling specific to the selected button.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx (truncated at the <Button onClick={login} ...>)",
