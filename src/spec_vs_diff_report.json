  "summary": "CompareSlotHeader was redesigned with a top “Option {slotNumber}” outlined banner using distinct border colors per slot, and the second line now lays out date + clock-icon variance badge + inline “Change” button with wrapping support. Two non-requested metadata/state files were also modified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Always show a compact clock-icon day-variance indicator inline next to the date (with the variance value secondary/tooltip), for each compare slot header.",
      "reason": "In the updated header, the variance indicator only renders when `variance !== null`. If `variance` can be null for any slot state, the UI would omit the variance indicator entirely, which may violate the requirement/AC that the second line shows the variance indicator inline next to the date.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/compare/CompareSlotHeader.tsx (conditional render: `{variance !== null && ( ... )}`)"
