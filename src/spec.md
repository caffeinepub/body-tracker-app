# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a short, one-sentence description under the CalendarView heading without changing any other layout.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the existing CalendarView `h2` to render the current heading text plus a second line of smaller, muted English description text directly beneath it.
- Keep all modifications confined to the selected `h2` element only.

**User-visible outcome:** The CalendarView page heading shows a brief, single-sentence description under the title explaining what the calendar/journey page does.
