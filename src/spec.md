# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the Calendar page’s “Compare Progress” outline button border and the main calendar container border slightly more prominent while staying consistent with the existing theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Update styling in `CalendarView` to increase border thickness/contrast for only the “Compare Progress” outline button instance (without affecting other buttons).
- Update styling in `CalendarView` to increase the outer border prominence for only the main fullscreen calendar container/component (without affecting other calendar instances).

**User-visible outcome:** On the Calendar page, the “Compare Progress” button and the main calendar’s outer border look slightly more prominent and easier to distinguish in both light and dark themes, with no other UI borders changed.
