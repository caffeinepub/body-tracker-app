# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the non-editing “Day Details” overlay in the full-screen day view more vertically compact without changing any font sizes.

**Planned changes:**
- Tighten vertical padding/margins/gaps in the Day Details overlay container, title area, and detail rows in the full-screen day view when not editing.
- Reduce line-height in Day Details overlay text to achieve a denser layout while keeping existing text size classes unchanged.
- Compact the Measurements subsection spacing (divider, section label, and rows) while ensuring the overlay remains readable and does not overlap key controls on mobile or desktop.

**User-visible outcome:** In the full-screen day view (non-edit mode), the Day Details overlay takes up noticeably less vertical space and looks consistently compact on both mobile and desktop, without smaller text.
