      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "In the full-screen day view (frontend/src/components/DayDetailView.tsx), when NOT editing, the Day Details overlay uses noticeably less vertical space than before.",
        "No typography sizes are reduced (e.g., existing text-* size classes remain the same), and the compaction is achieved via reduced padding/margins/gaps and tighter line-height.",
        "The compaction applies to: the overlay container padding, the \"Day Details\" title spacing, the detail rows spacing, and the Measurements subsection spacing (divider + section label + rows).",
        "The overlay remains readable and does not overlap key controls (date overlay, edit/close buttons) on typical mobile and desktop viewport sizes."
