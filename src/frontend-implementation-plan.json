        "The border/glow uses a rainbow gradient (multiple distinct hues across the spectrum), not just a blue/purple gradient.",
        "The glow is visibly animated (e.g., continuous rotation/pulse) under normal motion settings.",
        "The button’s dimensions and layout do not change (no content shift or resize due to the glow).",
        "The button remains fully clickable and behaves exactly as before (same onClick, disabled behavior preserved).",
        "When the button is disabled, the glow effect is subdued and does not animate.",
        "When the user has prefers-reduced-motion enabled, the animation is disabled while keeping a static rainbow glow."
